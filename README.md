VVX-Contact-App
===============
#v.1beta
Generates XML contact data for the Polycom VVX series phones.  

This was created to remove some of the monotony out of using XML Notepad 2007. (Recommended by the documentation to use)
No multiple select, will not edit file if there is a syntax error, and a bunch of erroneous behavior can be caused by shortcuts.

*Created using Angular.js and the Twitter Bootstrap Frameworks*
